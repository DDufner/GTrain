<h1>Add Category</h1>
<p>A category is a way to group together similar training topics.  For example, let's 
    say you want to have several topics to discuss with new staff regarding using the timcard application.
    All the topics can be added under the "Timecard App" category.  Categories created are kept in the database 
    and can have topics added and deleted. </p>
<form asp-controller="Category" asp-action="Add" method="post">
    <div class="form-group">
        <b><label asp-for="Name"></label></b>
        <input class="col-sm-4" asp-for="Name" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Name"></span>
    </div>

    <input type="submit" value="Add Category" />

</form>
